# hello-world

Hi Houmans,
I need to learn how to code, and it seems that'a a legit place to do so.
I want to give it a try, and see if I can cope with the new tech.
We'll see
I love basketball, reading, watching movies/tv series
my partner Aneta and my soon to be born son Olie 
That's about it, for now
:)
